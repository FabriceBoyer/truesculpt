Pussycat,
Finally I don't have to wait until I get home to sculpt stuff	This is a great sculpting app. I've been waiting for something like this for a while. I was able to sculpt fairly quickly, and when I hooked up my phone to my pc was able to copy the model over to my pc and open it in Cinema4D for further editing and rendering. Well done guys for creating this, I look forward to see the updates.


Bungholio,
It's about time...Finally android gets a decent sculpting app. This is a great app, no crashes yet, can't wait to see what great things are to come from this app. Looking forward to future updates.


Gunnar,
Fantastic! Very similar to modelling with clay which I have done a lot.


LitePack,
Tons of potential Really cool app with a great deal of potential.


Antonio Cesar,
AMAZING!!!	Spetacular app! Since I got my SII I'm looking for 3D app based os zbrush or sculptris. And this app made just my dream come true!!


MZ,
fantastic application I find myself highly addicted to using it whenever an idea strikes. I'm coming from Blender and it's extremely intuitive. Very well done. Keep adding the little tweaks :-)
