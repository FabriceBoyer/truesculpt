    <string name="InflateTool">
        Use this tool for global initial aspect of the sculpture. Blends smoothly with other deformation\n
        \n\n
        Technical details:\n
        Moves each vertex position in a direction normal to the surface of a sphere\n
        The intensity of the deformation decreases with the distance to the center of the selection area\n
        \n\n
        Parameters:\n
        - Strength positive to grow, negative to carve\n
        - Radius for selection area sizes\n
    </string>
    <string name="DrawTool">
        Use this tool for sculpting already displaced areas. The selected area is moved along it\'s current orientation. Don\'t hesitate to grow then carve a given area\n
        \n\n
        Technical details:\n
        Moves each vertex position in a direction normal to the current vertex normal\n
        The intensity of the deformation decreases with the distance to the center of the selection area\n
        \n\n
        Parameters:\n
        - Strength positive to grow, negative to carve\n
        - Radius for selection area size\n
    </string>
    <string name="GrabTool">
        Use this tool to adjust the position of a precise zone. No selection is performed\n   
        The deformation depends on the current point of view : Look from the side to grow. Look from above to repositionate\n
        \n\n
        Technical details:\n
        Moves each vertex position inside the current view plane\n
        The intensity of the deformation decreases with the distance to the center of the selection area\n
        \n\n
        Parameters:\n        
        - Radius for selection area size\n
        - Strength not used\n
    </string>        
    <string name="SmoothTool">
        Use this tool to remove unwanted spikes and jerky points\n
        \n\n
        Technical details:\n
        Moves each vertex to the barycentric center of all its immediate neighbours\n
        \n\n
        Parameters:\n        
        - Radius for selection area size\n
        - Strength not used\n
    </string>    
    <string name="FlattenTool"/>

    <string name="ClayTool"/>
    <string name="EmbossTool"/>
    <string name="NoiseTool">
        Adds random noise to the selected area\n
        Technical details:\n
        Moves each vertex of a random value along its current normal
          Parameters:\n
        - Strength positive to grow, negative to carve\n
        - Radius for selection area size
